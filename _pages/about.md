I am a neuroethologist working in the field of learning and memory. In particular, I am interested in how animals navigate complex environments and learn coherent representations of objects through exploration.

My main model organism is the fruit fly, Drosophila Melanogaster. Flies are capable of remarkably complex behavior and can be raised in laboratory fairly easily. In addition, it is possible to manipulate and record their nervous system using genetically encoded tools. As such, they are uniquely poised as a model for which behavior can be precisely quantified and linked to specific neuronal circuits.

I was trained as a biologist in Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier university, where I studied Cell biology and physiology as a bachelor. I did a master in Neuroscience, behavior and cognition before conducting a thesis on the behavioral, cellular and molecular basis of ambiguous olfactory learning in Drosophila. I am now conducting a postdoctoral project on object learning in Drosophila.

Ultimately, my goal is to better understand how a seemingly simple organism can generate a complex and flexible set of behavior, shedding light on a fascinating aspect of animals: their ability to learn and adapt. My hope is that one day my work leads to a better understanding of the computations of learning and memories in biological brains, leading to more efficient and flexible artificial systems.
